# Old school fractal cloud generator

This program is based on my old Amiga assembly program,
that was somekind of fractal cloud generator.

As youngster I read theory about it in early 90's.
In 2022, I tried to remember something about the theory
and understand my old Amiga assembly program.

This Python experiment is the result of that...
